# CenterNet
This is a strip of centerNet from MMdet to understand the architecture in depth . If you want to use the centerNet you it from [MMDetection](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/v2.13.0/index.html). I am using the tiny kittidataset and its also uploaded and you should be able to run it with

`python trainer.py`
